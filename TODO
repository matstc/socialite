how to test middleware
handle failures in sending the confirmation email
when showing the comment count -- only count the non-spam
ajax actions (marking comment as spam - marking submission as spam - voting up) should change the UI in the same way refreshing the page will
  for instance marking as spam should make the admin links red and show an undo link
  undoing marking as spam should make the admin links black again and it should say 'mark as spam' instead of 'no longer marked as spam'
  voting up should dim the post
why is the favicon not shown?
