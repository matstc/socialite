Show a list of recent comments on the right of the popular page

The comment count should only reflect the comments shown the submission page (currently, children to spam comments are counted too)

An admin dashboard that gives out links to recent spam stories and users

AJAX ACTIONS (marking comment as spam - marking submission as spam - voting up) should change the UI in the same way refreshing the page will
  for instance marking as spam should make the admin links red and show an undo link
  undoing marking as spam should make the admin links black again and it should say 'mark as spam' instead of 'no longer marked as spam'
  voting up should dim the post

Make the themes more powerful by changing images too -- not just css file.

Create more themes.

Internationalize and build a French version.

Show a tiny snapshot for each submission -- especially if the link is to a video or a picture (toggle this on and off from the admin section)
