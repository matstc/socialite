<h1>Welcome to Socialite</h1>

Socialite is a social news website in a box.
We want to make it ridiculously easy to spin off a new social news website.

The goal is to build a web application that will act as a social news website (think digg, reddit, or hacker news). But Socialite is meant to be more like a CMS, similar in functionality to Pligg. It will be possible to customize the web application to change its look, its managed content, and its general behavior.

Here is a list of features we will be building soon:

  - anti-spam filtering
  - page components for custom content
  - admin section
  - easy deployment


<h1>Deploying Socialite</h1>

We're not ready for prime time yet but if you want to check out the app, you can pull the code with git and run "rails server". Then point your browser to http://localhost:3000.

You can also check out the <a href="https://github.com/pmcfadden/socialite/blob/master/screenshot.png">screenshot</a> in the top-level directory:
