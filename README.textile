h1. Welcome to Socialite

Socialite is a social news website in a box.
We want to make it ridiculously easy to spin off a new social news website.

The goal is to build a web application that will act as a social news website (think digg, reddit, or hacker news). But Socialite is meant to be more like a CMS, similar in functionality to Pligg. Some things can be customized like the name and logo, the CSS theme, or the content of the about page.
