h1. Welcome to Socialite

Socialite is a social news website in a box.
We want to make it ridiculously easy to spin off a new social news website.

The goal is to build a web application that will act as a social news website (think digg, reddit, or hacker news). But Socialite is meant to be more like a CMS, similar in functionality to Pligg. It will be possible to customize the web application to change its look, its managed content, and its general behavior.

Here is a list of features we will be building soon:

  * allow admins to moderate comments the same way they moderate submissions
  * first comment on a submission does not show up ajax-style - i have to refresh the page to see it
  * use watir or such to test one or two user journeys
  * figure out test coverage and what tests are missing
  * "allow admins to delete a user (mark all their submissions and comments as spam and remove those from public view)
  * the comments should probably not be displayed but replaced with <marked as spam>"
  * admin users can pull up a list of users that have submitted nothing but spam or at least 3 spam submissions - they can then killspam these users
  * add nice styling to all pages + images (JQueryUI theme roller?)
  * admin section to change the style (choose among all JQuery themes?)
  * streamline the deployment of a new instance of socialite (aka one-liner install)
  * make sure the index page still displays nicely even if the title or the description of the submission is very large
  * user can submit a submission just to start conversation - no need for external link
  * index page shows thumbnails of urls or videos or images (toggled on or off in the admin section?)
  * the index page could be split into components where admins can inject custom html
  * modify the content of the about page from the admin section
  * a bookmarklet to submit posts from the bookmark toolbar
  * admin section to change the title + logo
  * admin section to change the favicon
  * allow original poster to edit their own post
  * show comments as well as submissions in profile page
  * hide the possibility to vote if user already voted for that submission
  * color the submissions that were clicked on / voted up by the current user / just marked as spam
  * show stats like users with highest karma and stuff
  * have a new page for most recent submissions
  * have the user click a link in their email before they can submit stuff


h1. Deploying Socialite

We're not ready for prime time yet but if you want to check out the app, you can pull the code with git and run "rails server". Then point your browser to http://localhost:3000.

You can also check out the "screenshot":https://github.com/pmcfadden/socialite/blob/master/screenshot.png in the top-level directory:
