h1. Welcome to Socialite

Socialite is a social news website in a box.
We want to make it ridiculously easy to spin off a new social news website.

The goal is to build a web application that will act as a social news website (think digg, reddit, or hacker news). But Socialite is meant to be more like a CMS, similar in functionality to Pligg. Some things can be customized like the name and logo, the CSS theme, or the content of the about page.

h2. Contribute

Socialite has no proper documentation available but you can have a look at the tests under the spec directory. Most of the features have accompanying tests so the tests serve as documentation. If you fork this project and request a pull, please include tests along with your new patch.

Have a look at "Matt's blog":http://clipboarded.blogspot.com/search/label/socialite for random bits of information about Socialite.

To setup your box for development, just follow the steps above to deploy your own instance of Socialite, but make sure to run the server in development mode by omitting the @-e production@. You can also skip the step where you run @rake production:initialize@

You can run tests by running the command @rake spec@

You can seed the database with test data by running the command @rake seed@
