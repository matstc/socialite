<h1>Welcome to Socialite</h1>
<p>Socialite is a social news website in a box.<br />
We want to make it ridiculously easy to spin off a new social news website.</p>
<p>The goal is to build a web application that will act as a social news website (think digg, reddit, or hacker news). But Socialite is meant to be more like a <span class="caps">CMS</span>, similar in functionality to Pligg. It will be possible to customize the web application to change its look, its managed content, and its general behavior.</p>
